# NNDL_project_Cars
Authors: Arina Ponomareva, Laura Marie Schulze, Lorenzo Martinelli

Final project for the course Neural Networks and Deep Learning, part of the master's degree cycle in Physics of Data delivered at UNIPD

## Outline
The project's goal is to develop deep learning architecture able to perform two tasks on a massive set of car images. Namely the tasks are classification and verification of cars based on their make. We also decide to test out a more fringe technique: Snapshot ensembling. For more details, one can check the report and the related bibliography, but in short snapshot ensembling is a technique that allows to take "snapshot" of the network while training and using them as a network ensemble, improving on the accuracy that the network can achieve. The baseline architecture for this project is EfficientNet-B0, due to its high accuracy and relatively low number of weights. Additionally, a couple of data augmentation techniques have been employed and tested out, to see which one holds better for this specific project.

The whole project has been carried out in Python.
